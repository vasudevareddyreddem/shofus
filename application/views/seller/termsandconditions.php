                      <li>SHOFUS is not involved in the actual transaction between Sellers and Buyers, buyer buys product from the seller at the price which is fixed by the seller and we (SHOFUS) delivers that product to the customers.</li>

                  <h3>5.The Transaction Processing Service.</h3>

                    <li>"Sales gross" means the gross proceeds from any of Your Transactions, including all shipping and handling, gift wrap and other charges, but excluding any taxes separately stated and charged. "Your Transaction" means any sale of your items through the Site. As used, "we," "us" and "our" mean SHOFUS Payments. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Participation Agreement, SHOFUS may in its discretion perform the Transaction Processing Services.</li>
                    <li>The Transaction Processing Service facilitates the purchase of Seller items listed on the Site. Sales gross are credited to a registered Seller's Payment Account and funds are periodically transferred to the Seller's designated bank account ("Seller's Account"). When a Buyer instructs us to pay you, you agree that the Buyer authorizes and orders us to commit the Buyer's payment to you (less any applicable fees or other amounts we may collect under this Participation Agreement).</li>
                    <li>You agree that Buyers satisfy their obligations to you for Your Transactions when we receive the Sales Proceeds. Our obligation to remit funds received by us on your behalf is limited to funds that we have received less amounts owed to SHOFUS, subject to chargeback or reversal or withheld for anticipated claims in accordance with this Participation Agreement.</li>
                    <li>The Transaction Processing Service helps facilitate Your Transactions and neither we nor our affiliates are the purchaser of the Seller's goods.</li>
                    <li>Seller will resolve any dispute directly with Buyer or with the assistance of the CIH (SHOFUS.com) Guarantee and not through the Transaction Processing Service.</li>
                    <li>You must provide us true and accurate information when registering and must maintain and update that information as applicable. </li>
                    <li>We may at any time require you to provide any financial, business or personal information we request to verify your identity. Seller will not impersonate any person or use a name he or she is not legally authorized to use.</li>

You may not create invoices for Your Transactions.</li>
                    <li>All balances for a given 7-day period will be reflected in the Payment Account summary. We will initiate a credit to Seller's Account on a rolling 7-day cycle ("Payment Date") based on the original date of Seller's registration with the Service or on the next Business Day if the scheduled Payment Date falls on a non-Business Day. If Seller requests a change to the scheduled Payment Date, the 7-day cycle will be reset to the requested Payment Date.</li>
                    <li>When you either initially provide or later change your bank account information, you must wait 7 days to request a transfer to Seller's Account. After 7 days, you may request transfers to Seller's Account.</li>

                    <li>The amount of the fees for the Services will be posted to Seller's Payment Account and will be deducted from the balance of credits in the Seller's Payment Account to be remitted to you on the next Payment Date. </li>
                    <li>Without limiting SHOFUS Payments' rights to collect any amounts you owe, including as described in this Participation Agreement, SHOFUS Payments' receipt of Sales Proceeds discharges your obligation to pay applicable fees and other amounts under this Participation Agreement to the extent the Sales Proceeds equal or exceed the fees and other amounts you owe and the Sales Proceeds are applied to the payment of those fees and amounts.</li>
                    <li>Transfers to the Seller's Account will generally be credited within seven Business Days of the date we initiate the transfer. On occasion, we may send Seller a paper check instead of an electronic credit to Seller's Account. We will do so, for instance, if Seller's bank will not accept an electronic credit to Seller's Account</li>
                    <li>As a security measure, we or our affiliates may, but are not required to, impose transaction limits on some or all Buyers and Sellers relating to the value of any transaction, disbursement, or adjustment, the cumulative value of all transactions, disbursements, or adjustments during a period of time, or the number of transactions per day or other period of time. </li>

                    <li>If we or our affiliates reasonably conclude based on information available to us or our affiliates that Seller's actions and/or performance in connection with the Services may result in Buyer disputes, chargebacks or other claims, then we may, in our sole discretion, delay initiating any remittances and withhold any payments to be made or that are otherwise due to you in connection with the Services or this Participation Agreement until the completion of any investigation(s) regarding any Seller actions and/or performance in connection with this Participation Agreement. We will not be liable to Seller if we act in accordance with the provisions of this Section.</li>
                    <li>All notices will be sent by e-mail or will be posted on the Site or by any other means then specified by us or SHOFUS. </li>
                    <li>• We will send notices to Seller at the e-mail address maintained in our or SHOFUS 's records for Seller.

                    <li>We may refuse service to anyone for any reason.

                    <li>We may obtain reimbursement of any amounts owed by Seller to SHOFUS or us by deducting from future payments owed to Seller, reversing any credits to Seller's Account, charging against gift certificates held in Seller's Account (if any) that were purchased with Sales Proceeds, charging Seller's credit card or bank account, or seeking such reimbursement from Seller by any other lawful means. You authorize us to use any or all the foregoing methods to seek reimbursement, including the debiting of your credit card or bank account.</li>
